# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews.

The simple `index.html` page allows a single movie review to be entered and once submitted it return a response with a sentiment assessment of the review being positive or negative.
